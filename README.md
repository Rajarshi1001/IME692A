Assignments for the course IME692A

## Assignment 1

- Trying out different forecasting methods like __Adaptive Exponential Smoothening__, __Holt's trend method__, __ARIMA__, 
__ETS__ etc.
- The solution to the first part is mentioned in the excel file `Question1.xlsx`
- The solution to the second part is given in the two R scripts which implements the __Holt's `linear method__ and the __adaptive exponential smoothing method__ for two different sets of data and calculates the __u-statistic__ for each set. 

## Assignment 2

- Multiple Linear Regression and estimators evaluation. The code is present in the R scripts in the folder along with the plots.
- Calculating probability distribution and CDF for minimum and maximum ($f(X_{max})$, $f(X_{min})$, $F(X_{max})$ and $F(X_{min})$) of a set of Random Variables for the case of **Chi-Square** and **Student-t** distributions.
